Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [http://ict.unitn.it/](ICT-Doctoral School), University of Trento and at the [https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt](HLT-MT lab), Fondazione Bruno Kessler.

My research focuses on Multilingual Neural Machine Translation, particularly for low-resource languages, under the supvervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marcellofedericohome/">Marcello Federico</a>. Feel free to check some of my [blog](https://surafelml.github.io/blog/) posts and [https://surafelml.github.io/posts/](publications).
