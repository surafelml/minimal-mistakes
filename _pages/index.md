Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="http://ict.unitn.it/">ICT-Doctoral School</a>, University of Trento and at the <a href="https://ict.fbk.eu/units/hlt-mt">HLT-MT lab</a>, Fondazione Bruno Kessler.

My research focuses on Multilingual Neural Machine Translation, particularly for low-resource languages, under the supvervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marcellofedericohome/">Marcello Federico</a>.
